#Scrabble / Countdown Solver

###Introduction

This is a Countdown / Scrabble Solver made in java which allows you to enter the tiles you have in your hand and will output the Top 10 words sorted by length.

It was originally a class assignment for Algorithms & Data Structures II (CS211)

###Future Plans

I don't have that many plans for this project at the moment as it kind of does what it needs to do at the moment, May add functionality for the numbers game in Countdown or potentially add the possibility of allowing file input and output.

I also may redo the algorithm with a better approach using Regular Expressions.
